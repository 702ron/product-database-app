## 3. Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

```
Product {
  id: UUID (primary key)
  productName: String
  lotNumber: String
  truckNumber: String
  source: String
  upc: String
  asin: String (nullable)
  link: String (nullable)
  condition: Enum (NEW, USED, PARTS_ONLY)
  damaged: Boolean
  missingItems: Boolean
  whatsMissing: String (nullable)
  notes: Text (nullable)
  mixedId: String (nullable)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}

ProductImage {
  id: UUID (primary key)
  productId: UUID (foreign key)
  type: Enum (STOCK, MAIN, BOX, OTHER_1, DAMAGE_1, DAMAGE_2)
  path: String
  fileName: String
  mimeType: String
  size: Integer
  isVisible: Boolean (for conditional visibility of damage images)
  uploadedAt: DateTime
}

User {
  id: UUID (primary key)
  username: String
  email: String
  passwordHash: String
  role: Enum (ADMIN, EDITOR, VIEWER)
  createdAt: DateTime
  updatedAt: DateTime
}
```

### Frontend Architecture
- React.js for UI components
- Redux or Context API for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Formik or React Hook Form for form handling
- Material UI or Tailwind CSS for styling

### UI Design System
Based on 2025 UI design best practices, the application will follow these principles:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**
   - Clean layouts that guide users to their goals
   - Elimination of unnecessary elements
   - Focus on essential content and features
   - Single primary action per view

2. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Size, color, and contrast to emphasize key elements
   - Strategic use of whitespace to create logical groupings
   - Primary actions made visually prominent
   - Consistent typography with clear hierarchy

3. **Image Gallery Modal System**
   - Separate image viewing experience from product data entry
   - Modal-based image gallery similar to eBay's approach
   - Lightbox effect for viewing full-sized images
   - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys for browsing, ESC to close)
   - Clear close button for modal dismissal
   - Swipe support for mobile devices

4. **Conditional UI Elements**
   - Dynamic form fields that appear/disappear based on selections
   - Clear visual indication of required vs. optional fields
   - Progressive disclosure for complex data entry

5. **Accessibility**
   - Sufficient color contrast for text readability
   - Alternative text for images
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - ARIA attributes for screen readers

6. **Mobile Responsiveness**
   - Adaptive layouts for different screen sizes
   - Touch-friendly interface elements
   - Optimized image loading for mobile data connections

### Backend Architecture
- Node.js with Express (or alternative like Nest.js)
- RESTful API endpoints
- JWT for authentication
- Multer for file uploads
- Database ORM (Prisma, Sequelize, or TypeORM)

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL or MongoDB for database
- Cloud storage (AWS S3 or similar) for images
- Docker containers for development and deployment
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

## 4. Deployment Plan

### Staging Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment after passing integration tests
- Perform smoke tests
- Get stakeholder feedback

### Production Deployment
- Use blue-green deployment strategy
- Implement database migration
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Configure backups

## 5. Risks and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
- Image storage may become costly as the database grows
- Performance issues with large datasets
- Security vulnerabilities with file uploads

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement image compression
- Set up pagination and lazy loading
- Add file type validation and virus scanning
- Implement proper access controls

## 6. Future Enhancements

- Batch import/export functionality
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Barcode scanning capability
- Integration with inventory management systems
- Mobile app for field use
- AI-based product categorization
- Automated image recognition for damage assessment
- Multi-language support
- Dark mode interface option
- QR code generation for product tracking
